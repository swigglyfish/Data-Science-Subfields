In this two-part project, I explore questions posted on the <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Data Science Stack Exchange</a> in order to examine the relevancy of different subfields. While I refer to all of the different categories under examination as subfields or topics, I examine all aspects of data science, including specializations, programming languages, libraries, software, etc. that are relevant to the field.

The primary objective of this project is to help students who are studying data science navigate the ever-changing field and determine which of these subfields they should study. Since data science is incredibly new field, it is constantly changing and thus difficult to ascertain which aspects of data science are going to be most useful for them to learn.

There are three different topics I delved into while developing this project. The first two are detailed in part 1, while the third is detailed in part 2.
- The relevancy of different data science subfields
- How frequently the most relevant subfields are used together
- The data science topics that are most likely to remain relevant in the next five years

Both of the datasets I worked with on this project can be downloaded here:
- **Part 1:** <a href="Datasets/questions_2020.csv">questions_2020</a>
- **Part 2:** <a href="Datasets/questions_2014_2020.csv">questions_2014_2020</a>

Both datasets were generated using SQL queries on Stack Exchange Data Explorer.
